# DEPRECATED
# I have decided not to pursue pure JS Angular 2 (Or any Angular 2), this project is outdated, stuck on an early beta of ng2, and should likely not be used.

An opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS 2](https://angular.io/) projects.

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com//chad-autry/ng2bp
$ cd ng2bp
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Finally,
```sh
$ npm run server
```
hosts a local server and auto-launches a browser window. The server refreshes the hosted files whenever a build is run, just refresh the browser.

Happy hacking!

## Purpose

ng2bp is a template of my personal practices for building a front end client

## Philosophy

I try to follow the KISS principle where possible

## Learn

### Overall Directory Structure

At a high level, the structure looks roughly like this:

```
ng2bp/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app component tree structure>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- common/
  |  |  |- <reusable modules and components>
  |  |- less/
  |  |  |- main.less
  |- node_modules/
  |- package.json
  |- target/
  |- travis.yml
```

What follows is a brief description of each entry, but most directories contain
their own `README.md` file with additional documentation, so browse around to
learn more.


- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, dependencies used for building the app and includion into it, scripts used to build and test the app
- `node_modules` - the location npm stores all dependencies
- `target/` - where all temporary built files go, webapp is the subdirectory where the final application lives
- `travis.yml` - the instructions to TravisCI which allow it to build and push back the finished app to our github page

### npm scripts

//TODO document all the npm scripts here

## Roadmap

This project is mostly meant as a personal example, but documentation doesn't kill anyone and it could likely use even more in order to make it approachable by others
